How to stay current with technology progress.

Cloud computing was still in its infancy, and there was a good chance that I might be able to establish myself as a leading regional authority on the topic.

a dirty little secret of that kind of role is that, although you're sold as an expert in some new technology, you're often only a few weeks ahead of your customer.

as a consultant you're also unencumbered by all the daily responsibilities and politics that often occupy the time and energy of regular employees. 

Still, after years of learning new technologies, I'd started recognizing certain patterns. Perhaps, I thought, well-designed technologies are based on some fundamental ideas that may be worth learning instead.

Trying to keep abreast of all new technologies in your field is likely to lead to burnout. Rather, put yourself in a position so that you can quickly learn necessary skills, just in time.
