However, we live in a world where there was a culture in our department to blame end users for code instability. If something crashed on a new input, I was expected to make a case to other departments that they wrote their requirements wrong.

I entered the workforce when interest rates were so low people were speculating on what would happen if they went negative. Investors had to make money but also had to compete with loans that would barely turn a profit. So they casted extremely wide nets throwing money at anyone with an idea in hopes of getting any return possible. A lot of these ideas needed programmers.
And it turns out when companies are desperate for programmers, they will hire almost anyone.
