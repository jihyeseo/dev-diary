Third, learn one thing at a time. Maybe you are really into learning a musical instrument, so you spend a few nights a week practicing chords or learning a new song. Maybe it is functional programming and you spend a your commutes listening to famous talks on FP. But don't think you can do it all at once. The people who seem to have it all still probably got there one bit at a time.

it's not an on-off switch, but a steady progression towards supplanting your busy work with 'smart' work, good luck

I study for an hour every morning on a subject I enjoy right after I finish my first cup of coffee - right now I’m learning Japanese but I’ve done other things like building apps or reading history books. Main thing is always making sure it’s something I’m personally interested in, and I don’t multithread. Interestingly time bounding myself makes it more fun because I look forward to coming back to it vs getting tired of it
