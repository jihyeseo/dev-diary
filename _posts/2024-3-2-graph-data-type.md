Graphs are also widespread in business logic.

There is almost no graph support in any mainstream language. None have it as a built-in type, very few have them in the standard library, and many don’t have a robust third-party library in the ecosystem.

Many, many graph algorithms are NP-complete or harder.

They eventually found that a generic graph type simply couldn’t compete with handpicking the representation for the problem.

Even graph databases, designed entirely around running complex graph algorithms, struggle with this problem.

After leaving that job, she worked as a graph query performance consultant. This usually meant migrating off the graph database. 

Graph Querying Languages
Graph querying languages (GQLs)6 are to graph databases what SQL is to relational databases. 

Python added a graphlib in 2020.
